# Architecture

Deep implementation detail: read this when changing the request path, the agent loop, the tool
registry, the extension host or the terminal presentation. `docs/extensions.md` covers the plugin
surface; this file is where the *how* lives — request flow, loop discipline, tool and approval
rules, the extension host, the rendering contract.

Model resolution is one shared chain, `providers::resolve_run_model` (`-m` > `LLM_MODEL` > the
session's model > the stored default; a bare model name served by more than one provider errors
listing the `provider/model` candidates instead of silently taking the first in config order), and
every provider `/models` fetch plus the messages API build headers through
`providers::auth_headers(kind, key)` (Anthropic: `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version`; openai-compat:
Bearer).

Request flow: `main.rs::dispatch(argv)` routes to a command module → the command resolves a model
from config → `providers::ResolvedModel::stream()` dispatches on the config `kind` (`openai-compat`
or `anthropic`) → `http.rs` does sync POST + SSE parsing under a codex-shaped, deliberately lean
error taxonomy (`HttpError::class()`: Connection/RateLimited/Server retry, Auth/InvalidRequest
fatal, ContextTooLarge sniffed from 400 bodies — OpenAI "maximum context length", Anthropic "prompt
is too long", Google "exceed context limit" — PayloadTooLarge for a 413 (whose body is usually a
gateway wrapper naming nothing, so the size we sent and the shrink-the-attachments remedy are
appended to it), Stream for post-start drops, Interrupted for esc); each adapter's `run` builds its
body and hands it to `providers::check_request_body` first, which refuses a body past
`input.max_request_bytes` — `http::MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (32MB, the documented provider ceiling)
unless `agent.max_request_bytes` in config.json lowers it, since a gateway in front may refuse far
less — while it can still name the
attachments that filled it: compaction prunes tool results, never attachment payloads, and a resumed
thread reloads every attachment it stored, so the remedy has to reach the user;
retries resend with ±10%-jittered backoff (1s→30s for responses, a separate 5s→60s×6 budget for
connection failures — bounded for an attended terminal: ≈ three minutes of automatic fighting, then
the error surfaces), honoring a server Retry-After when sent, sleeping in 50ms interruptible slices
with a dim `retrying in Ns` notice, extracting `x-request-id`/`cf-ray` into the error text, and
never replaying after output was already handed out — a mid-stream drop instead keeps the partial
answer as a real assistant message and continues from it (assistant-last is a prefill for both wire
shapes), bounded at 5 recoveries per run before the error surfaces with the partial in history; a
drop that arrives before any output — no text, no reasoning, no tool call — is resent unchanged
(nothing was handed out, so nothing can duplicate), sharing the same 5-recovery budget; a
stream that ends without a completion marker (`[DONE]`/`message_stop`) is surfaced as truncation
rather than a clean turn (a clean FIN on a half-delivered answer must not be stored as a finished
round), and an Anthropic `message_start` seeds the input/cached token counts that the edge merges
with the `message_delta` output counts — every field an event omits keeps the value an earlier one
established, so a delta repeating only `input_tokens` cannot drop the cached halves it was already
given. A stream silent past 300s is an idle error, not a hung task.
The body read runs on its own thread with 100ms `recv_timeout` slices checking the interrupt flag,
so esc works during silent thinking stretches — and the whole blocking request phase (DNS, TCP, TLS,
body upload, response headers, plus attachment GETs) runs on a worker polled the same way
(`send_raw_interruptible`/`get_with`), because a connect black-holed by a dead network offers no
other hook for the flag: esc used to sit ignored until OS defaults gave up (Linux SYN retransmits ≈
2min; a TLS handshake to a black-holed host, the 1800s global ceiling). The dial itself is bounded
too — `timeout_resolve(5s)`/`timeout_connect(10s)` on the shared agent (ureq leaves them unlimited)
so a dead endpoint fails into the retry path in seconds, while a real stream is untouched (those
bound dialing only, the global 1800s still covers generation) → events flow back as `http::Event`
(`Delta` / `ReasoningDelta` / `Done { usage }`), consumed by `term/render.rs::TaskView`, the
presentation shared by the REPL and the one-shot agent — spinner (the redraw thread is
`term/ticker.rs`) plus the typewriter heartbeat (`DrainTicker` in the same file): settled stream
text lands in a backlog and drains in one time-gated installment per 16ms tick — base 2 chars
(≈125/s, readable), one more per 24 waiting, capped at 24 per tick so no frame ever dumps a chunk;
bursts read as fast typing that decelerates into the base rate, a keeping-up stream never paces, and
everything stays write-once (no erase, no redraw — pacing only decides when bytes are written); any
non-interrupt keystroke sets `screen().flush_now` and the next tick prints the whole backlog at once
(the user is watching), a single dim `thinking ... end` trace line (reasoning is never streamed
anywhere), and the dim `secs · this task: input N · output N · cache N% read · N% write` footer.
Every field is the task's own rounds summed — a re-sent prompt per round, so never a context size,
and `input` counts the cached reads in, which makes the absolute number meaningless as a bill: the
shares are what it cost, the read half billed at a tenth of the input price and the written half at
a premium. `Usage::write_percent` rides along only on wires that report a write count (Anthropic;
the automatic-caching openai-compat ones keep none), and `cache_label` is the one formatter behind
both this footer and `/status`. `/status` shows the pair for the whole session — seeded from a
resumed thread's stored turns, so it describes the conversation rather than the process — plus the
last round's read share whenever it differs: one round reading nothing back is what a compaction or
a prefix change looks like from the outside, and the session average lags behind it. The context
occupancy lives there too; answers stream character-immediately and styled pi-like in a left-indent-2 block
on a TTY through `StyleStream` (`core/render_md/`), write-once — no erase, no redraw: each line
classifies from its first chars (heading, quote, list, fence, table, rule) and the settled prefix
streams, while an unclosed inline marker (`**`, `` ` ``, `~~`, `[`) holds only its own span until it
resolves or the line ends (then it flushes literally — the one physical cost of write-once styled
output); rows hard-wrap at the terminal width (re-read at every line start, so a resize applies from
the next row; unicode-width cells, tabs advancing to the next 8-column stop from the absolute
column; a space within the last few cells breaks early so word middles are usually spared), open SGR
spans re-open after each break, list/quote/fence continuation rows align under the content, `|`
table rows pass through verbatim (live and replay alike — the simple way: column widths need the
whole table and write-once output cannot restyle printed rows), and an unclosed inline marker holds
at most 80 bytes before degrading to literal text so a prose bracket or stray backtick never stalls
the stream so wrapped continuation rows keep the margin instead of soft-wrapping to column 0 (only
the `>` prompt and `$` tool chrome sit at column 0), and the spinner never starts over a dangling
partial row (`Renderer::has_dangling` guards it), paints its first frame only after one tick and
retracts only a row it painted — a wait that ends at once (the round after a settled answer) must
not blink a frame under printed text, and `turn_end` restarts it only when one is already up (the
tool cycle's `resume_running`/`resume_wait` cover the waits): everything the answer area shows is
append-only, which `ci_repl.py` asserts by rejecting any erase sequence after the answer's first
byte; replay (`render_once`) runs the same engine over whole lines — h1
color+bold+underline, h3+ keep their `### ` prefix, visible ``` fences (the border always prints as
three backticks, and a fence may be indented — the common shape inside a list item — in which case
its closing run must still close the block: the live stream holds a line that is only whitespace and
backticks until it knows, or the whole rest of the answer would render as code), `│ ` quotes,
four-space list nesting, `[x]` task markers, setext headings, `min(80, width)` rules — and for
well-formed (single-blank-separated) markdown the streamed answer and the replay are byte-identical;
pipes stay raw and unstyled. The agent loop feeds TaskView `AgentUpdate`s and keeps its tool `$`
chrome and approvals locally. Every outbound request carries a real `user-agent` (`llm/<version>`,
never ureq's library default — `http::identity_headers()`, merged in `send_raw`/`get_with`); the
provider adapters add the vendor half on top (`providers::gateway_headers(url)`, also on the
catalog's /models fetch): for `opencode.ai` hosts the `x-opencode-session` conversation id OpenCode
Go/Zen demands with a 400 `MissingSessionID` when it is absent — one ulid per process, pinnable
across processes with `LLM_SESSION_ID`.

- The agent is the whole CLI: `main.rs::dispatch` routes only `--version`/`--help`; **everything
  else is `commands/agent.rs::run(argv)`** — bare `llm` on a terminal is the interactive REPL, text
  and piped stdin are one-shot tasks (pi's shape; there is no typo guard, an unknown word is a
  task). Remaining subcommand modules are `pub fn run(argv: &[String]) -> i32` parsing their own
  flags via `args.rs` specs; only two are left: the package commands (`commands/pkg.rs`: `install
  git:github.com/user/repo[@ref]` clones into `~/.llm/pkg/<name>`, `-l` project-local into
  `.llm/pkg/` (`-g` the explicit default), re-running refreshes unless pinned, `remove`/`list`;
  `pkg::carried` classifies a clone by layout — `skills/`, `extensions/`, `commands/` and a root
  `SKILL.md` (a whole-repo skill, mounted by `skills::load_package`, which the bare `skills/` walk
  would miss), reported by `install`/`list`; everything a clone carries mounts, with no menu to
  narrow it: the scope flag is the only question, `-l` project-local, the user dir otherwise; in
  the skills walk user pkg
  loads before project pkg, so project wins) and `export` (`commands/export.rs`: `llm export [PATH]`
  writes the working directory's newest thread — else the newest anywhere, i.e. what `-c` would
  continue — as markdown through `core/export.rs`; the REPL's `/export [PATH]` shares
  `export_thread` for the live session id, defaulting to `llm-<id>.md`).
- `providers/message.rs` holds the unified conversation model — `Msg` (User messages carry
  `attachments: Vec<Attachment>`; `Msg::user_with` builds them), `ToolDef`, `ToolCall` — so the
  agent depends on providers, never the reverse. A tool result carries an `error: Option<ToolError>`
  (`Failed`/`Denied`/`UnknownTool`/`Interrupted`) rather than a bare bool — the wire shapes only
  send the current `is_error`, but a stored thread keeps the class, and the old `is_error` boolean
  still reads as `Failed`. An assistant message keeps `reasoning: Option<String>` beside the opaque
  `reasoning_meta` the provider needs replayed with it (Anthropic's thinking `signature`): the trace
  without its signature is a 400 on the next turn, so both persist even when the visible text is
  empty. Both provider adapters serialize attachments per mime (`attachment_block`): image blocks,
  OpenAI `file`/`input_audio` plus a text part for `text/*`, Anthropic `document` (base64 PDF or
  plaintext `text/plain`/`text/csv`); unsupported mimes error client-side before any request leaves,
  naming the accepted set (`build_body` returns `Result` for exactly that); a record stored without
  its bytes — a resumed attachment whose source is gone — rides as a text note naming it, never an
  empty data URI.
- `core/attachments.rs` is the shared loader: `load_args()` runs the `-a` entry-flag loop for
  prompt and agent; `Loaded` keeps path/url/mime/bytes provenance so one load feeds both the wire
  (`request()`) and the log store (`stored()`); magic-byte `sniff_mime` covers stdin and clipboard
  bytes; `wants_stdin()` lets `-a -` claim stdin away from the prompt text.
- The agent (`src/agent/`, the whole binary): sync loop over the same `Event` stream — `tools/` (eight
  handwritten tools, one file per tool behind the shared `mod.rs`: `update_plan` (the codex-shaped
  checklist — a `{step, status}` list with at most one `in_progress`; it touches nothing, so it is
  Read-tier and never prompts, and the plan lives in the model's own tool call so no harness-side
  state is needed), read (`path`/`offset`/`limit`; bare text with a pi-shaped continuation note,
  images become vision attachments), write, edit with exact-match spans (both landing through a
  same-dir temp-file + rename so a crash mid-write cannot truncate the target, the existing mode
  carried over; pi's exact, unique-match rule), bash streaming live through
  `platform::run_shell_stream` in a new session/process group (a timed-out kill keeps the partial
  output it already printed — the deadline and the output are independent facts — and reports
  `Command timed out after Ns (process killed)`; no default timeout, matching pi), grep and glob
  both delegate to ripgrep (`rg --fixed-strings` when `literal: true`, `.gitignore` respected,
  hidden files included), ls, webfetch (the one way off the machine); bash previews show as `run`
  via `display_verb`), `approval.rs` (read/write/exec tiers used for the parallel read batch and the
  hardcoded-refusal scoping — there is no ask mode: a call runs unless the hardcoded list refuses it,
  a `[agent] tools` policy denies/prompts it, or the blacklist asks; symlink-aware `escapes_cwd`, fed
  per call by the tool's own `Tool::escapes_cwd` (the shared `path` argument by default, a
  `$VAR`-expanded scan of the command line for `bash`), an extension's `tool_call` reply may deny,
  rewrite args, or `decision: "allow"` to skip the ask (a blacklist ask still prompts — the ask-list
  is extension-proof); the hardcoded `FORBIDDEN_COMMANDS` (`approval.rs`: `sudo`/`su`/`doas`,
  `mkfs*`/`mkswap`, `dd`/`shred`/`wipefs`, `fdisk`/`parted`, `shutdown`/`reboot`/`poweroff`/`halt`/
  `init`) plus `forbidden_command`'s shape checks (fork bomb, redirects into real device nodes —
  `/dev/null` and other sinks are exempt, `2>/dev/null` is stream hygiene — and `rm` whose target
  word is `/`, `/*`, `~` or `$HOME`, matched on the whole word so `rm -rf /tmp/build` stays ordinary
  cleanup) are outright `Deny`, none of which any file, flag or `!` line can switch off; then the
  user-editable ask-list (`blacklist.rs`: `~/.llm/blacklist` plus the nearest `.llm/blacklist`,
  project lines winning by last match; word patterns hit a command position anywhere in the line,
  segment patterns match the whole segment, globs work, `!` re-allows), seeded with `rm`,
  `git push --force*` and the active `outside-cwd` directive: a hit is an `Ask` — immune to allow
  policies — with the matched pattern highlighted in the prompt, and `a` spares the pattern for the
  session (`blacklist_session_allows`, never persisted), `session.rs` (the Session: one
  model + tools + accumulated history, thinking level, steer queue shared with the KeyWatcher, turn
  persistence (failed and interrupted rounds too, so a late stream drop cannot erase the transcript
  from /resume), the wire messages the thread file stores verbatim; `rebuild_tools` is the single
  registry-build path — built-ins + extension tools — shared by the CLI entry, `switch_model` and
  `/reload`), `ext/` (the extension host — `mod.rs` plus `manifest.rs` for script manifests,
  `proto.rs` for the stdio loops and `roots.rs` for discovery; pi's extensions done out-of-process:
  user executables in `~/.llm/extensions/` plus the nearest `.llm/extensions/`, project winning by
  name (a package's `extensions/` dir mounts as it stands), in two forms — **manifest script tools** (a `# ---
  llm-tool: name` comment header on any script in any language; the host spawns per call, single
  argument rides as `argv[1]`, `run_with_progress` owns timeout/stdin/stdout/exit-code; no exec bit
  needed so Windows works too) and **resident extensions** (spawned once, speaking newline-delimited
  JSON — the `initialize` handshake (carries `"v": 1`) advertises tools/commands/events, `call_tool`
  runs a mounted tool, `run_command` answers a slash command, `event` fires
  `agent_start/input/turn_start/turn_end/tool_call/tool_result/agent_end` (5s deadline; a
  `tool_call` reply denies or rewrites args and gates before the approval matrix, a `tool_result`
  reply's `{"content": ..}` replaces the model-visible result — the event carries the full content,
  so subscribing is the opt-in; `Extensions::subscribes` skips building that payload when nobody
  listens, the loop re-caps the replacement through `tools::truncate_marked` (2000 lines/50 KB),
  last rewrite wins and every failure mode is fail-open, leaving the tool's own result; failures
  land in the extension's diagnostics tail, never aborting a run); writer/reader threads with an
  id-correlated pending map, parallel connect (started on a background thread at CLI startup so
  handshakes overlap the thread store, attachments and system-prompt reads; the CLI joins before
  building the tool registry) that degrades per extension, `/reload` respawns, `extensions.disabled`
  + `extensions.tool_timeout` in config, with a resident extension allowed to ask for a longer
  `tool_timeout` in its `initialize` reply (clamped to an hour — a tool that runs a build or another
  agent needs it) and ctrl+c sending the busy extension an `interrupt` frame naming the abandoned
  call so it can stop its own children; an extension's stderr is streamed into the running call's
  tool log as live progress (dim, never part of the result, so a long tool can report without
  polluting what the model reads); extension tools are Exec-tier; the wire protocol is fully
  documented in `docs/extensions.md` with runnable examples in `examples/extensions/` —
  `repeat_guard.py` gates `tool_call`, `fold_repeats.py` rewrites `tool_result`, `subagent.py`
  mounts a `subagent` tool that runs a child `llm --json` with its own tools and system prompt from
  `~/.llm/agents/*.md` / `.llm/agents/*.md` (defined and discovered entirely inside the extension;
  `examples/agents/` ships four)), `repl.rs` (slash commands `/help /model /thinking /login /logout
  /resume /tree /export /clear /skill:<name> /status /reload /exit` — /memory /init /settings
  /tools /skills /compact were removed: config is hand-edited, compaction is automatic
  (token-threshold in the loop), and extension state shows in /status + /reload; `run_skill` submits
  a `<skill name dir>` task — the
  dir is what lets a slash-run skill read its own `references/`), `!cmd` shell passthrough with
  bash-style tab completion — command positions (first word, or right after `|`/`&`/`;`) complete
  executable names from `$PATH`, later words complete filesystem paths as typed, dirs getting a
  trailing `/`, hidden entries only after a dot prefix — unknown `/name` first asks the extension
  host (`Extensions::command_owner` → `run_command`, reply printed dim), then the commands dir, then
  plain task text; extension commands join the `/`-completions, a near miss of a known command only
  prints a did-you-mean and sends nothing; slash and `!` input echoes bold in the line editor;
  `/resume` loads a picked past conversation into the live session (rebuild_thread), `/tree` rewinds
  to a picked turn (seed and thread file truncate just before it —
  `threads::Store::truncate_thread`), `/reload` re-discovers skills + extension tools + settings
  (plugin files are otherwise read at startup only; restart or `/reload` picks up a mid-session
  change — no fingerprint probe runs per task anymore); the resume replay clips every row to the
  terminal width (`history_rows`, one line per entry, `truncate_cells` charging the ellipsis and CJK
  its two cells) so a long tool payload cannot bury the next row, and the message cap counts
  messages, not rows; the startup banner is the bold identity line plus dim label rows — work ·
  context, session, and the live plugin surface: `plugins` lists resident extensions and manifest
  script tools by name (`Extensions::plugin_names`, a resident one that never connected reads
  `(failed)`), `skills` the discovered skills; either row disappears when its list is empty, six
  names is the cap (`+N more`), and the ctrl+o page reprints the same rows; `--fork` branches the
  loaded session onto a new thread id sharing its turns so far via `threads::Store::fork_thread`),
  `compact.rs` (cut at a turn boundary keeping a 20k-token recent window, pi's default; the stored
  summary is the summarizer's own text — re-compaction updates it incrementally through
  `<previous-summary>` tags — and `trim_old_attachments` swaps attachments older than the last two
  attachment-bearing messages for a name+mime note every round, before the request is built; a
  compaction that cannot run — summarizer error, empty summary, no cut point — is reported as a
  `compact_stalled` notice naming why, once per run, because a window quietly left over its limit is
  the one failure compaction exists to prevent; the check runs *before* each model request, not
  after a completed turn, so a ctrl-c that kills the round cannot skip it (a resumed thread is
  compacted on its first request); the trigger is `window - 16384` — the model's real window minus
  pi's reserve — when the per-model option `context_window` records one, else
  `agent.compact_at_tokens` (64k by default) for an unknown window; it never changes across the run;
  a prompt the provider refuses still forces one compaction and retry, bounded, and a known window
  also catches the silent overflows a gateway hides behind a 200 — usage above the window, or a
  length stop that produced nothing after consuming ≥99% of it — with the same
  forced-compact-and-retry; a round the provider reported no usage for is priced from the text
  instead, so a gateway that omits the counts cannot switch the gate off; ctrl-c keeps the round's
  own messages — the pending prompt and any partial answer already streamed — so /resume starts from
  what was actually said, not a gap).
  Read-only calls from one assistant message (every tool at `Tier::Read`) run concurrently on scope
  threads after a serial gating pass — approvals, extension `tool_call` hooks and the ToolStart
  chrome stay ordered, and results, tool logs and history are replayed in call order — while
  mutating and exec calls stay strictly serial; `prepare_call`/`finish_call` in `mod.rs` are shared
  by both paths so they gate and finish identically, and the provider adapters ask for
  `parallel_tool_calls` so the model may batch independent reads into that one message, and a
  tool-result pruner at compaction pressure
(`prune_tool_results`: once `should_compact` fires, results over 8192 chars become head 4096 + a
middle marker + tail 1024 before the summarizer runs, and the pass reports `freed_tokens` — the loop
subtracts them from the usage-derived estimate, because re-estimating over the same usage marker
reports the identical number and would let the summarizer run anyway; a resumed thread that no
longer fits is projected down the same way before its first request, silently
(`Session::prune_seed_to_fit`), so the notice cannot repeat turn after turn); the cut middle is
dropped, pi's lossy shape, char-indexed cuts keep CJK on codepoint boundaries, `skills.rs`
(SKILL.md discovery with pi's spec validation — description required, name rules warned — and
`skills_block()` rendering pi's `<available_skills>` block verbatim, uncapped; the full file is
one `read` away), `settings.rs`, `system_prompt.rs`
(pi's shape: persona, an available-tools list, guidelines, AGENTS.override.md/AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
project-instruction discovery, skills, and a self-extension block naming the extensions/skills dirs
and the manifest-header form; a continuation from a stored prompt keeps it verbatim and refreshes
only the trailing cwd line). The system prompt stays byte-identical across
every round: providers cache by request prefix (DeepSeek context caching, Anthropic prompt caching),
so any per-turn mutation re-bills the whole history at cache-miss price. Both adapters engage the
cache deliberately: the anthropic one sends explicit `cache_control` breakpoints (on the system text
block, caching tools+system together, falling back to the last tool when there is no system; on the
last message the previous request carried — the stable anchor `PromptInput::cache_anchor` names,
resolved at assembly so a trailing tool-result run lands inside the marked block — plus on the
current conversation tip; colliding onto one block when a tool round adds no user turn, and skipping
the never-resent one-shot prompt) because Messages API caching is opt-in and a marker on the moving
tip alone would rewrite the whole history at write price every round and read none of it back. The
anchor is carried across task boundaries too: `Session::cache_anchor` names the seed a resumed
thread or the next REPL task hands over (`AgentOptions::cache_anchor`, dropped when the loop's own
projection shortened that seed), so a task's *first* request opens a breakpoint window on the prefix
the previous request already wrote instead of carrying the tip alone. `agent.cache_ttl` picks the
entry's lifetime (the API's five-minute default, or the hour interactive work wants — an approval
prompt or a long test run outlives the short one, and the next round then re-writes the prompt);
the default emits no field, so a config that names it changes nothing on the wire. Anthropic's
`message_start` seeds the input/cached token counts, and it folds `cache_read`+`cache_creation` into
`Usage.input` to match openai-compat's whole-prompt
`prompt_tokens`; the openai-compat side is automatic server-side, with a `prompt_cache_key` (the
session's `cache_key`) pinning one conversation to one replica — automatic caching is per-replica,
so a round-robin hop serves the next round cold — and its hit count parsed from all three usage
shapes (`providers::cache_hit_tokens`: DeepSeek, OpenAI, OpenRouter). Anything that rewrites history
mid-conversation invalidates the cached prefix from the change point, so the two pruning passes are
gated on `compact::rewrite_prefix` (half the trigger, well below the compaction gate) instead of
running every round, and the typewriter's settle wait is bounded by `SETTLE_GRACE` because it runs
on the agent thread — a long answer tail must not hold the next tool round hostage.
`commands/agent.rs` is CLI glue only. While a task runs, KeyWatcher buffers typed lines into the
steering queue and the loop drains them at the next tool boundary; leftovers become new tasks. When
the answer owns the current row (`term::screen`'s dangling flag), the watcher defers its `queued:`
notice to the render thread, which prints it at the next settle point (`TaskView::flush_notices`) —
erasing the row in place tore the streamed text apart and dropped the continuation at column 0.
- Plugins ride one plumbing: extension tools run free like `bash` — there is no ask mode — and a
  per-tool policy or the blacklist still gates them; commands-dir
  prompts (`core/commands_md.rs`: `~/.llm/commands/*.md` plus the nearest `.llm/commands/`, project
  wins) have no CLI dispatch — the REPL's unknown `/name` falls back to them, expanding `$input`
  through `core/templates.rs` (the internal substitution engine).
- `llm -r` (`commands/threads.rs`, the browser): one filterable list of recent threads through the
  shared picker — the list is scoped to the current directory (pi-shaped:
  `threads::Store::recent_threads(limit, Some(cwd))` filters on the last turn's `cwd`, oldest
  spelling variants included via `Path` comparison), falling back to every directory when this one
  has no history, each row then tagging its directory; selecting shows the transcript, then one
  Y-key question continues that conversation in the agent session via `run`. `/resume` in the REPL
  shares `threads::pick_thread`. `--session`/`--cid` accept unambiguous id prefixes via
  `threads::Store::resolve_thread(prefix, Some(cwd))` — a prefix matching several threads resolves
  to the local one — and `-c` takes `latest_thread(Some(cwd))` before the global newest. The `llm
  logs` CLI (list/full/on/off/status) is gone.
- The provider/model lifecycle is REPL-internal (`commands/models.rs` and `commands/login.rs` are
  library-only now, no CLI): `/model` runs the provider→model→thinking cascade
  (`cascade_model_picker`), switches the live session via `Session::switch_model`
  (`providers::resolve_model_by_id`) and saves the choice as the shared default; `/thinking` adjusts
  the depth alone; `/login` runs the wizard (catalog + Cloudflare/Azure URL templates + custom;
  hidden-input key capture, an omitted key falls back to the catalog entry's env var as a `${VAR}`
  reference), `/logout` the removal picker (clearing the default when it pointed at the removed
  provider). Pickers build from `providers/catalog.rs` (pi's provider registry, 38 entries incl.
  opencode-go in both wire kinds and four local runtimes: ollama, lm-studio, llama.cpp, vllm;
  OAuth-only and cloud-signature providers deliberately absent). A fresh session still starts on the
  stored default.
- `src/read/` is the text-file reading module behind the agent's read tool: streaming line windows
  (`window()`: BufReader, offsets skip without keeping, the agent tool clamps to a 2000-line window
  under the shared 50KB cap — pi's values, so one read covers a typical source file), per-line
  2000-char cap, one lookahead line decides `Exact` vs `AtLeast` totals), the `BINARY_EXTS` gate +
  NUL sniff, and `binary_hint` mapping binary formats to local tooling (pdf→pdftotext,
  bam/cram→samtools, parquet/hdf5→duckdb, office→libreoffice). Memory stays bounded by the window;
  nothing but text is ever parsed.
- `src/core/threads.rs` is the conversation store: one JSONL file per thread under
  `user_dir/threads/<ulid>.jsonl`, one `StoredTurn` object per line — one line per agent **round**,
  appended at the round boundary (`AgentUpdate::RoundEnd`), so a crash loses only the round in
  flight and a compaction can never retract work the transcript already wrote (a `v` format stamp first —
  `THREAD_FORMAT_VERSION`, absent on pre-versioning lines — then id, ts, mode, model, cwd, system,
  prompt, response, reasoning, usage, options, and the round's wire `messages` as the same
  `providers::Msg` values the request carries). `usage` is `[input, output, cached, cached_write]`
  (`threads::TurnUsage`, the fields the wire reported, cache split and all); the `[input, output]`
  pair older lines hold still reads, and any other length is refused rather than filled with zeros.
  `rebuild_turns` returns that usage summed along with the replay, so a resumed session starts its
  `/status` totals from what the transcript already spent. `append_turn` appends a line (a None thread id
  starts a fresh thread), `read_thread` returns turns oldest-first under two dsh-borrowed
  disciplines — a corrupt line mid-file fails loudly (refusing a damaged thread beats silently
  resuming without a turn) while a torn final line (a crash mid-append) is the one bounded repair:
  dropped with a warning — and a turn stamped with a future format is refused with the upgrade path
  named; `latest_thread`/`resolve_thread`/`fork_thread`/`recent_threads` serve the resume and list
  surfaces (the list falls back to the last parseable line, so a torn tail never hides a thread).
  Resume is codex-shaped: a thread id reopens its file — no SQL, no FTS, no b2 content addressing.
- `term/lineedit.rs`: raw-mode line editor with completion (VMIN=0/VTIME=1 polled reads where
  `read()==0` means timeout, never EOF — EOF is the 0x04 byte), the KeyWatcher steering buffer, and
  the one picker `pick(title, items, echo)` used by every list in the tool — arrow-move +
  type-to-filter in the fzf shape (UTF-8 accumulates across bytes so CJK filters work,
  space-separated terms AND-match case-insensitively, enter returns the original index);
  The buffer is multiline (codex-shaped): `\r` submits while ctrl+j (`\n`), alt+enter,
  shift/ctrl+enter, a lone `\` before enter (a doubled `\\` submits literally) and bracketed paste
  insert real newlines — the platform clears ICRNL so `\r`/`\n` stay distinct, and the kitty
  keyboard protocol's disambiguate flag (`ESC[>1u`) is pushed only for the read's duration so
  modified enter arrives as CSI-u keys; kitty terminals that re-encode plain ctrl+letter as CSI-u
  (ctrl+c = `CSI 99;5u`) are folded back to the C0 byte so every ctrl binding keeps working, and a
  lone or CSI-27u ESC interrupts like ctrl-c (one press clears the line, two exit; the watcher and
  approval prompts keep plain-ESC semantics); ↑/↓ recall history only while browsing, from an empty
  buffer, or parked at the very start of the top line — the working draft is saved on first recall
  and restored on the way back past the newest entry — and otherwise walk logical lines with a
  sticky preferred column; readline keys round it out (ctrl-a/e cross lines at boundaries,
  ctrl-k/u/w + alt-d feed a single-entry kill buffer that survives submit, ctrl-y yanks, alt-b/f and
  ctrl-arrows move by word); ctrl+g round-trips the draft through `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` (guards
  dropped, cooked mode, then re-acquired); pastes over 10 lines or 1000 chars become an atomic
  `[paste #N +L lines]` token whose payload expands at submit; history persists to `history.jsonl`
  (below).
- Model ids are namespaced `provider/model`; the `aliases` object in config.json maps friendly names
  on top (a legacy standalone aliases.json folds in once and is ignored).
