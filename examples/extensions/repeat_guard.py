"""repeat-guard — loop hygiene as a resident llm extension (dsh-style guard).

Copy to ~/.llm/extensions/repeat-guard.py, chmod +x, /reload. It mounts no
tools and no commands; it subscribes to two events and denies the call that
keeps a stuck loop alive:

  input      — a fresh user message resets the repeat streak (a new
               instruction is never treated as a loop)
  tool_call  — counted per (tool, arguments) with arguments compared modulo
               key order; from the REMIND_AT-th consecutive identical call
               the call is denied and the reason (the reminder) reaches the
               model as the tool's error result

This is the deny-flavored twin of the in-core advisory RepeatGuard (which
lets the call run and rides a [System] note on its result). Load either one,
not both: a denial here means the core guard never sees a third identical
call, so together they are redundant rather than harmful. What the event
protocol cannot express is the advisory middle ground — a deny gate can only
refuse — which is why the core keeps its own copy.

One honest limitation: the protocol has no config channel for resident
extensions, so the threshold lives in this file. Edit REMIND_AT and /reload.
